    - summary: Use [OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions v1.39](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/releases/tag/v1.39.0)
      details: |-
        There are breaking changes which affect the attributes on spans produced by this package:

        - `rpc.system` is replaced by `rpc.system.name`;
        - `rpc.service` is removed;
        - `rpc.method` is now the fully-qualified name (`cerbos.svc.v1.CerbosService/CheckResources` instead of `CheckResources`); and
        - the numeric `rpc.grpc.status_code` is replaced by the string `rpc.response.status_code` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` instead of `3`).
