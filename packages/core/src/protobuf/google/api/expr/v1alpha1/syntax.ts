 * calls. This makes it easy to represent new operators into the existing AST.
 *
 * All references within expressions must resolve to a [Decl][google.api.expr.v1alpha1.Decl] provided at
 * type-check for an expression to be valid. A reference may either be a bare
 * identifier `name` or a qualified identifier `google.api.name`. References
 * may either refer to a value or a function declaration.
 *
 * For example, the expression `google.api.name.startsWith('expr')` references
 * the declaration `google.api.name` within a [Expr.Select][google.api.expr.v1alpha1.Expr.Select] expression, and
 * the function declaration `startsWith`.

 * A comprehension expression applied to a list or map.

 * Comprehensions are not part of the core syntax, but enabled with macros.
 * A macro matches a specific call signature within a parsed AST and replaces
 * the call with an alternate AST block. Macro expansion happens at parse
 * time.
 *
 * The following macros are supported within CEL:
 *
 * Aggregate type macros may be applied to all elements in a list or all keys
 * in a map:
 *
 * *  `all`, `exists`, `exists_one` -  test a predicate expression against
 *    the inputs and return `true` if the predicate is satisfied for all,
 *    any, or only one value `list.all(x, x < 10)`.
 * *  `filter` - test a predicate expression against the inputs and return
 *    the subset of elements which satisfy the predicate:
 *    `payments.filter(p, p > 1000)`.
 * *  `map` - apply an expression to all elements in the input and return the
 *    output aggregate type: `[1, 2, 3].map(i, i * i)`.
 *
 * The `has(m.x)` macro tests whether the property `x` is present in struct
 * `m`. The semantics of this macro depend on the type of `m`. For proto2
 * messages `has(m.x)` is defined as 'defined, but not set`. For proto3, the
 * macro tests whether the property is set to its default. For map and struct
 * types, the macro tests whether the property `x` is defined on `m`.
