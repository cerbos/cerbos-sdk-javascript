/**
 * `Visibility` defines restrictions for the visibility of service
 * elements.  Restrictions are specified using visibility labels
 * (e.g., PREVIEW) that are elsewhere linked to users and projects.
 *
 * Users and projects can have access to more than one visibility label. The
 * effective visibility for multiple labels is the union of each label's
 * elements, plus any unrestricted elements.
 *
 * If an element and its parents have no restrictions, visibility is
 * unconditionally granted.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     visibility:
 *       rules:
 *       - selector: google.calendar.Calendar.EnhancedSearch
 *         restriction: PREVIEW
 *       - selector: google.calendar.Calendar.Delegate
 *         restriction: INTERNAL
 *
 * Here, all methods are publicly visible except for the restricted methods
 * EnhancedSearch and Delegate.
