# Cerbos JavaScript SDK

[Cerbos](https://cerbos.dev) helps you super-charge your authorization implementation by writing context-aware access control policies for your application resources.
Author access rules using an intuitive YAML configuration language, use your Git-ops infrastructure to test and deploy them, and make simple API requests to the Cerbos policy decision point (PDP) server to evaluate the policies and make dynamic access decisions.

The Cerbos JavaScript SDK makes it easy to interact with the Cerbos PDP from your Node.js and browser-based applications.
