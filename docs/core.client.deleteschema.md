## Client.deleteSchema() method

Delete a schema.

**Signature:**

```typescript
deleteSchema(id: string): Promise<boolean>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  id | string |  |

**Returns:**

Promise&lt;boolean&gt;

## Remarks

Requires

- the client to be configured with [Options.adminCredentials](./core.options.admincredentials.md)<!-- -->,

- the Cerbos policy decision point (PDP) server to be configured with the [admin API](https://docs.cerbos.dev/cerbos/latest/api/admin_api.html) enabled, and

- a dynamic [storage backend](https://docs.cerbos.dev/cerbos/latest/configuration/storage.html)<!-- -->.

The way this method handles failure depends on the version of the connected PDP server. When the server is running Cerbos v0.25 or later, it returns `true` if the schema was deleted and `false` if the schema was not found. With earlier versions of Cerbos, it throws an error if the schema was not found, and returns successfully if the schema was deleted; the returned value should be ignored.

## Example


```typescript
const deleted = await cerbos.deleteSchema("document.json");
```
