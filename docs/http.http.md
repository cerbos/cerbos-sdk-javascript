## HTTP class

A client for interacting with the Cerbos policy decision point server over HTTP.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class HTTP extends Client 
```
<b>Extends:</b> [Client](./core.client.md)

## Remarks

This is primarily intended for use in browsers, and requires `fetch` to be available globally. If you're targeting [old browsers](https://caniuse.com/fetch)<!-- -->, you'll need to apply [a polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/whatwg-fetch)<!-- -->.

You can use it in server-side Node.js applications, but the [gRPC client](./grpc.grpc.md) might be more appropriate.

- For Node.js up to 17.4, you'll need [a polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-fetch) to make `fetch` happen.

- From Node.js 17.5, you can instead enable the [--experimental-fetch](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v17.x/docs/api/cli.html#--experimental-fetch) option at the command line or via `NODE_OPTIONS`<!-- -->.

- From Node.js 18 onwards `fetch` is available without any additional configuration.

See [the parent class](./core.client.md) for available methods.
