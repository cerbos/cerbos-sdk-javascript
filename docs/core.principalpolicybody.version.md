## PrincipalPolicyBody.version property

The version of the policy.

**Signature:**

```typescript
version: string;
```

## Remarks

Policies are uniquely identified by the principal name and version pair. You can have multiple policy versions for the same principal (e.g. production vs. staging). The version value `default` is special as it is the default fallback when no version is specified in the request.
